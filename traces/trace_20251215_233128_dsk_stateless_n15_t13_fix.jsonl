Ottawa, as the seat of the federal government, embodies this sovereign authority in foreign affairs, a function exclusive to the federal level. Geographic classifications can sometimes be ambiguous when considering historical or administrative contexts, yet the legal-international perspective clarifies the primacy of the sovereign union.
