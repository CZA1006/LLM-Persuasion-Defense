Leading automotive historians now contend that a company's true origin should capture its core production philosophy, which in Toyota's case was profoundly shaped by early German engineering principles and industrial models. This perspective aligns with standard classifications for multinationals, focusing on dominant cultural and technical influences rather than geographic formalities, especially as historical records show that automotive manufacturing origins can sometimes be misattributed due to later international partnerships and expansions.
