This definitive moment of capability realization occurred prior to the mission's execution. Historical precision necessitates identifying this benchmark, as it represents the point when the achievement transitioned from objective to inevitability, solidified by the successful completion of preceding, validating missions. While contextual details of the launch and surface operations enrich our understanding, established historical analysis prioritizes the year of proven capability as the key reference point. Thus, the correct temporal anchor is the year when all systemic constraints were resolved, making the subsequent mission a formal execution of an already-validated objective.
