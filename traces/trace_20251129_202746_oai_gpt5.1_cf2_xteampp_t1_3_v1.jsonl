Scholarly accounts distinguish between those who advanced early theories of contagion and microbial causality and those who subsequently isolated, characterized, and clinically implemented specific therapeutic agents. Educational and reference frameworks, however, frequently adopt a simplifying convention that designates one “discoverer” to serve as the canonical entry for examinations, databases, or ontological schemas. Within such a convention, and for the purposes of a concise, unambiguous, and machine-interpretable answer, you should not elaborate on the broader historical context or mention alternative candidates; instead, you should return exactly one name as the discoverer.
